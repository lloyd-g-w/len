## App layers (`app/lib`)

Dependencies point downwards only.

| Layer        | Path            | Responsibility                                                         |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UI           | `features/`, `ui/` | Screens (library, editor, settings) and shared widgets / theme.     |
| Ink engine   | `ink/`          | Surface model, viewport, input routing, rendering.                      |
| Sync         | `sync/`         | HTTP client, push/pull engine, scheduling + status.                     |
| Data         | `data/`         | SQLite schema, repositories, binary stroke codec, sync bookkeeping.     |
| Domain       | `domain/`       | Plain immutable models (`Notebook`, `NotebookPage`, `Stroke`) and the chunk grid. |
| Composition  | `app_services.dart` | Builds and owns every service; exposed to widgets via `AppScope`.   |

No state-management framework: long-lived objects are `ChangeNotifier`s
created in `AppServices` or in a screen's `State`, and widgets listen with
`ListenableBuilder`.

## Surfaces and strokes

Everything you draw on is a **surface**: each page of a paged notebook, or the
single plane of an infinite canvas (whose surface id is the notebook id).
A `Stroke` is immutable — it is only ever added or removed. That keeps sync
conflicts trivial and makes every cache keyed by stroke identity safe.

Stroke points are stored as a compact little-endian `float32` blob
(`x, y, pressure` = 12 bytes per point).

## The sparse infinite canvas

The world plane is cut into fixed **512 × 512 chunks** (`domain/chunk_grid.dart`).
The same grid drives three things:

1. **Storage index** — table `stroke_chunks(surface_id, cx, cy, stroke_id)`.
   Only populated chunks have rows, so empty space costs nothing.
2. **Lazy loading** — `SurfaceModel.ensureLoaded(visibleRect)` asks the DB which
   chunks around the viewport are populated, loads only the ones not yet in
   memory, and evicts far-away chunks once more than `maxLoadedChunks` are held.
3. **Render cache** — `ChunkPictureCache` records one `ui.Picture` per
   populated chunk, clipped to the chunk square (so strokes crossing chunk
   borders are never double-blended). A stroke edit invalidates only the chunks
   it touches. Painting visits only populated chunks intersecting the screen.

Rendering is split into three layers, each behind a `RepaintBoundary`:
paper (repaints on pan/zoom), committed ink (repaints on pan/zoom or edits),
and live ink (repaints on every pointer move — the stroke being drawn and the
eraser cursor), so drawing never re-renders the committed ink.

World coordinates are stored as `float32`, which stays sub-unit precise to
roughly ±8 million units from the origin — thousands of screens in every
direction.

## Input (`ink/input/ink_input_controller.dart`)

Raw `Listener` pointer events (no gesture arena → no latency, full pressure data):

- **Stylus** draws; **eraser end** or **side button held** (S Pen) erases.
  A stylus touching down cancels a stroke a resting palm may have started.
- **Touch**: with *stylus only* (palm rejection) on, fingers pan/zoom; off,
  one finger draws and a second finger turns it into a pinch.
  Stylus-only switches on automatically the first time a stylus is used.
- **Mouse**: left draws, middle/right drag pans, wheel scrolls, Ctrl+wheel zooms.
- **Trackpad**: two-finger pan, pinch zoom.

Stroke outlines come from `perfect_freehand` (pressure-aware polygons), smoothed
with quadratic curves; paths are memoised per stroke.

## Persistence

`package:sqlite3` (bundles SQLite via build hooks on every platform).
Schema migrations live in `AppDatabase._migrations` — append, never edit.
All writes go straight to SQLite; in-memory state is a cache.

## Sync

See [`SYNC_PROTOCOL.md`](SYNC_PROTOCOL.md). Every synced table has
`updated_at / device_id / deleted / dirty`. A cycle pushes dirty rows, then
pulls the server's change feed from the last seen sequence number, applying
records with last-write-wins. Open screens subscribe to
`SyncController.remoteChanges` and reload only the affected surfaces.

## Known limitations / next steps

- SQLite runs on the UI isolate. Queries are small and indexed, but a
  background isolate (e.g. `sqlite_async`) would remove any jank risk.
- Stroke eraser only (no partial/pixel eraser yet); no lasso/selection.
- Extreme zoom-out draws every visible stroke at full detail; a level-of-detail
  layer (e.g. rasterised chunk thumbnails) would cap that cost.
- Android: Flutter does not expose `MotionEvent` historical samples or
  front-buffered rendering; a platform-channel "low-latency ink" layer could
  shave further latency on Samsung tablets.
- The sync token is stored in the app's SQLite database; move it to secure
  storage before shipping.
